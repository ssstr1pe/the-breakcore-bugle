# The Breakcore Bugle - November 2025 Edition

What's up my breakcore baddies!

Hope everyone had a great time at Bangface! We were supposed to be there this year, but Mr Bugle double booked himself with a Lorde concert, accidentally. Mr Bugle booked the wrong night of the Lorde London shows, and he is also a Lorde superfan, so go figure. We're already looking forward to next years Bangface though - see you there!!!

We hope you all also had a spooky October/November... Who's cold? Me too ... I'm freezing ...  Every day ... Come ye, weary traveller... Warm thyself, by my hearth made of pure CCCCCCCCCCCoreeeeeee.........

## Releases of the month

November has been fruitful... Got some treats... For u... Some repeat offenders ... some new suspects ... let's investigate ...

### Mexicancore - Varixs Artistas vol.1

![Mexicancore - Varixs Artistas vol.1](./mexicancore-varixs-artistas-vol-1.jpg)

Starting off with a real special one here! Mexicancore is, if you're unfamiliar, a netlabel focusing on bigging up all latinx producers of Xcore... This is an absolutely stellar first installment, with bangers from some names you may know of, redHat, glitchgirl, Hitori Tori, etc.

Buy it on [Bandcamp](https://mexicancore.bandcamp.com/album/varixs-artistas-vol-1)!

### Prediction Error - Predatory Microtransactions

![Prediction Error - Predatory Microtransactions](./prediction-error-predatory-microtransactions.jpg)

We missed this one last month! We only found it on Reddit after releasing the October article - Predatory Microtransactions came out Oct 20th. We don't care. We're featuring it!!!

Oh man... This album... Where to even start - a mash of glitchcore, prog rock, smooth jazz? Big band jazz? A wild ride for sure.

This album is basically, what if Chon, Drumcorps, and Trigun: The First Donuts had a child together. A wild ride of crazy breaks and guitar solos. LFG.

Prediction Error has since had a couple more releases, but we'd really like to highlight this one. It's stellar.

Buy it on [Bandcamp](https://predatorymicrotransactions.bandcamp.com/album/prediction-error)!

### F8TLE33 - The Day After

![F8TLE33 - The Day After](./f8tle33-the-day-after.jpg)

Glossy, glassy, ethereal, and most importantly, LOUD madness. Not really a breakcore ep, tbh, it's "post-club", a term we've not heard before at The Bugle... Either way, this EP is really frickin cool, don't care if it's not BxC :P

Buy it on [Bandcamp](https://formforum.bandcamp.com/album/the-day-after)!

### XXHARDBIT3S - CRASHOUT!!

![XXHARDBIT3S - CRASHOUT!!](./xxhardbit3s-crashout.jpg)

3 tracks of dark, techstep goodness. Long dancy sections with some beautifully chopped and produced breaks. When we listen to xxh4rdbit3s, we get a lot of producer envy. We wish we knew how to make breaks sound that damn crirrrrrrrspy... It's like a "drop the skincare routine" moment... Envy...

Buy it on [Bandcamp](https://xxhardbit3s.bandcamp.com/album/crashout)!

### Maru303 - Brisk Workout

![Maru303 - Brisk Workout](./maru303-brisk-workout.jpg)

Classic jungle out now on Murder Channel... Seriously addictive high energy jungle vibes that we're gagging to hear people play out O.o

Anyway... This EP does exactly what it says on the tin! Listening feels like the briskest of workouts... LET'S GET THOSE KNEES HIGH PEOPLE! OH YES!

Buy it on [Bandcamp](https://murderchannel.bandcamp.com/album/brisk-workout)!

### Noise 4 Tots - Noise 4 Tots

![Noise 4 Tots - Noise 4 Tots](./noise-4-tots-noise-4-tots.jpg)

This is a special and cute little entry! Noise 4 Tots is the collaborative project between Wolf Merrick of [Deformat Records](https://www.deformatrecords.com/) and, you (maybe) guessed it... His tots! Wolf and his tots bring u 4 tracks of breakcore, gabber, and more!

Buy it on [Bandcamp](https://deformat.bandcamp.com/album/noise-4-tots)!

## Singles of the month

We spent a lot more time on SoundCloud in the last month (Mr Bugle is not a fan of the platform at all, maybe an incoming rant article one day? No one wants to read that - but anyway - been on SC more this month, so we have a waaaaayyyyyy more extensive list of singles than usual for your eardrums to get acquainted with!

We really don't know how to describe this one :D
