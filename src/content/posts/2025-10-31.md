I don't have to say anything. It's Ruby My Dear! This album is incredible, I've found it very hard to stop listening. The tracks were so amazing live at Rave Against The Machine.

## Singles of the month

We also said at first we'd do 5 singles a month to spotlight. We lied - we've been finding it difficult to keep up with singles released on SoundCloud and stuff. Here's a few though, that we hope you like - we did!
